Titre principal

Search Less. Understand More.

Sous-titre

An AI-powered deep research platform that goes beyond search engines —
structured answers, curated sources, and traceable reasoning, in one place.

Texte d’introduction

DeepSearch AI transforms how you explore information.
Instead of returning links, it builds knowledge: crawling trusted sources, structuring data, and reasoning across documents — locally, securely, and transparently.

What Is Deep Search?

Texte

Traditional search engines stop at results.
Deep Search goes further.

DeepSearch AI:

Breaks down your question into research steps

Identifies authoritative sources

Extracts, compares, and validates information

Produces structured, explainable answers

Stores results in a reusable knowledge library

You don’t just get answers — you get understanding.

🧩 SECTION — Core Capabilities (3 cartes)
Carte 1 — AI Research Agent

Autonomous Research Agents

Your question is converted into a research plan.
Each agent:

Defines sub-questions

Searches relevant sources

Extracts key facts

Cross-checks contradictions

Documents its reasoning

No black box. Full traceability.

Carte 2 — Interactive Scraper

Human-in-the-Loop Scraping

Control what the AI keeps.

Review extracted content

Skip irrelevant sections

Add verified sources to your library

Build trusted datasets step by step

Perfect for documentation, monitoring, and analysis.

Carte 3 — Knowledge Library

Your Private Research Memory

Everything you validate is stored:

Structured notes

Source links

Summaries

Extracted facts

Reusable across future searches.
Your knowledge compounds over time.

🧪 SECTION — Interactive Scraper (Detailed)
Titre

Interactive Scraping, Done Right

Texte

Most scrapers blindly collect data.
DeepSearch AI puts you in control.

For every source:

Preview extracted content

Accept or reject sections

Tag and categorize information

Link content to a research session

This ensures:

Higher signal-to-noise ratio

Zero hallucinated sources

Clean, reusable datasets

🧠 SECTION — How It Works (Step-by-step)
Étape 1 — Ask Anything

You start with a question, topic, or hypothesis.

Examples:

“What are the limits of GitHub Pages?”

“Compare open-source LLM orchestration frameworks”

“Summarize legal implications of AI-generated content in the EU”

Étape 2 — Research Plan Generation

The AI generates a research plan, including:

Search queries

Target sources

Extraction strategy

Validation steps

You can edit or approve the plan before execution.

Étape 3 — Source Exploration

The agent:

Browses documentation

Extracts structured data

Flags uncertainty

Highlights conflicting information

Étape 4 — Review & Curation

You decide:

What gets saved

What gets ignored

What becomes part of your knowledge base

Étape 5 — Final Answer

You receive:

A clear synthesized response

Source-backed claims

Structured sections

Exportable notes

🔐 SECTION — Privacy & Local AI
Titre

Privacy-First by Design

Texte

Your research stays yours.
